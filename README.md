This project is an interactive Java program that visually represents a three-dimensional geometric object â€“ a tetrahedron. The program allows users to manipulate the tetrahedron in real time through various actions, including:  
- Rotating the tetrahedron around the X, Y, or Z axis,  
- Translating (moving) it through 3D space,  
- Scaling it, meaning increasing or decreasing its size.  

As the user performs these transformations, the program simultaneously displays the corresponding matrix values that represent the tetrahedron and its individual vertices. This provides insight into the mathematical operations (such as rotation, translation, and scaling matrices) that are used to transform the object graphically.

The entire project was developed using the Java programming language and Swing packages.
